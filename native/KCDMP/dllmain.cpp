    // per-frame C_ModulesManager::Update tick does not start until well
    // past the splash/menu screens, into an actually-loaded save. Injecting
    // the moment the module is merely loadable hooks the import correctly
    // but checks for ticks far too soon, and a one-shot check with no retry
    // aborted permanently before the pipe or sampler ever started. Verified

    // loaded, ticked immediately ("25 frames in ~1s") -- this isolates the

    // thread (see DllMain below), so waiting costs nothing but time -- it
    // does not block the game or the loader. The ceiling is generous, not
    // measured: a player may sit at the main menu for a while before
