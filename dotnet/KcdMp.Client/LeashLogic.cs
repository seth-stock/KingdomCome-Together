///   * past WarnM (600): one warning per excursion; it re-arms only after the
///     joiner has been back under WarnM - 50 (550);
///   * past PullM (650): a 10 s countdown, one message a second; back inside
///     PullM cancels it; at zero, a Pull (the joiner is brought beside the host);
///   * any hold reason (either player downed, loading, in a cutscene, a
///     dialogue or a menu; the host in a non-Henry stretch or reloading; no
///     fresh joiner position) freezes the countdown where it was and starts
///     nothing new; it resumes from the same second;
///   * the host fast-travelled: a Pull at once (no countdown) as soon as
///     nothing holds it, unless the joiner is already within 50 m;
///   * a pull that fails (not placed, no answer in 12 s) waits 20 s before
///     the next countdown; three failures in a row pause the pulls (warnings
///     only) -- fail closed. A "busy" refusal (the joiner became busy as the
///     pull arrived) is not a failure.
///
/// WO-147 (the first long two-player session: the pull almost never came):
///   * only a state that makes a pull unsafe for the JOINER holds it: the
///     joiner loading, in a dialogue or a cutscene, downed or respawning, or
///     the host loading (<see cref="Blocking"/>). The host's menus, dialogues
///     and cutscenes no longer hold (the host's world runs behind them since
///     WO-138), nor does the joiner's menu (the pull places him while it is

///   * the pull waits for its answer the link's own round trip, not a flat
///     12 s (<see cref="PullTimeoutMs"/>): a 20 s backlog is not a failure;
