// WO-127 -- Steam as a connection path, plain connection errors, the
// connection test. Still protocol v9: no new message type, no new length.
//
// * Position flag 0x40 HOST CLAIM: the sender runs the session (the launcher
//   started the relay for it, or it runs a shared world from inside a world).
//   The relay reads it for the authority decision and CLEARS it before the
//   Ghost fan-out, so receivers see exactly what they saw before.
// * Connection test: a Handshake whose release field is
//   ConnectionTestRelease. Every relay since WO-110 R9 answers a release it
//   does not run with 0x3D [its release] and closes, so the test never becomes
//   a session (no id, no Name broadcast, no ghost). A WO-127 relay appends
//   "\0ready=<n>;host=<0|1>" to that one reply and logs it as a test, not a
//   refusal. Only a test ever sends that release, so no real agent sees the
//   suffix.
