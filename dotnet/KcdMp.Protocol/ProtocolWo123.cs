// WO-123 -- send the world, pause the host (docs/WO-123-findings.md).
// Protocol v9 (this WO's bump also carries WO-122's WorldSaved 0x46/0x47).
//
// A join: the joiner (at the main menu) asks, the host pauses its world,
// writes a fresh world save (WO-122 Phase 4), and streams the file to the
// joiner over the relay in chunks; the joiner verifies it and later reports
// "ready" (loaded and in the world, the next WO), which unfreezes the host.
//
// Every message is between two machines. Up bodies start with the TARGET
// ghost id and the join id; the relay routes to that one peer and prefixes
// the SOURCE id, so a Down body is [sourceGhostId:1] + the Up body verbatim.
//
//   type up/down  name           up body (after [target:1][joinId:4])        sent by
//   0x48 / 0x49   JoinRequest    [flags:1]                                 (6)  joiner -> host
//   0x4A / 0x4B   WorldOffer     [size:4][chunkSize:4][chunkCount:4][sha256:32][wsSeq:4][md5:16] (69) host
//   0x4C / 0x4D   WorldChunk     [index:4][data:1..WorldChunkMaxData]   (10..32777)  host
//   0x4E / 0x4F   WorldAck       [next:4] every chunk < next is written    (9)  joiner
//   0x50 / 0x51   WorldDone      [sha256 prefix:8] hash + Verify passed   (13)  joiner
//   0x52 / 0x53   JoinAbort      [reason:1]                                (6)  either
//   0x54 / 0x55   JoinerReady    [wsSeq:4] the world it loaded             (9)  joiner
//   0x56 / 0x57   JoinStatus     [state:1][reason:1][arg:2]                (9)  host
//
// Routing (relay): the joiner's messages (request, ack, done, ready) go to
// the damage authority only -- target 0xFF means "the host" -- and are
// dropped from the authority itself; the host's (offer, chunk, status) are
// accepted only FROM the damage authority. Abort goes either way. Lengths
// come from ONE table, JoinWire, which the relay's gate and the tests read.
//
// Sizes: a frame's payload length is a u16, so a chunk is at most 32 KB of
// data; the relay's per-client queue is 512 KB and overflow disconnects the
// client (WO-110 4.4), so the sender keeps at most WorldWindowBytes (256 KB)
// unacknowledged, and the receiver acks every WorldAckEvery chunks and on
// the last one. TCP keeps the order, so chunks arrive in index order.
