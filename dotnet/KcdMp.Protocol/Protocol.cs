/// EquipmentManager.EquippedArmorsByClassId AND EquippedWeaponsByClassId via
/// the reflection debug API -- NOT the SharedSoulGuid used by the combat
/// layer, and not an item instance id. Weapons (WO-10) were added to the same
/// message rather than a sibling one: EquipItem/UnequipItem/CreateItems are
/// item-class-agnostic (confirmed live, WO-10 -- the same calls that equip an
/// armor class equip a weapon class), so the wire payload and the receiver's
/// diff/apply logic need no new shape, only a second source map on the
/// outbound read. itemCount is small in practice (a full outfit plus one or
/// two weapons is under 20 slots) but bounded at
/// <see cref="Protocol.MaxAppearanceItems"/> so a malformed sender cannot
/// make a receiver allocate an unbounded array.
///
/// Sent only when the local player's equipped set changes, plus a slow
/// unconditional heartbeat (see GameBridge) so a peer who joins after the

/// remember or replay appearance for a late joiner, exactly like it does not
/// for position.
///
/// The receiver diffs against what it last applied to that ghost (client-side
/// state, not on the wire) and only touches the slots that actually changed:
/// unequip what dropped out, equip what is new. This is the same

///
/// Pause/world-halt mitigation layer (WO-11). KCD2's UI-state pauses (the
/// system menu, inventory, sleeping/skipping time) have no reachable native
/// veto (docs/WO-11-findings.md, tier A closed) -- the local player's own
/// tick keeps running, so this is not about un-pausing them. The problem is
/// the shared-world side effect. Each client runs its own full simulation
/// (HANDOFF-WO4-combat.md), so a player sitting in a menu stops advancing
/// relative to a peer who is not.
/// C→S  0x1C  PauseUp:   [state:1]                       (1 byte)
/// S→C  0x1D  PauseDown: [sourceGhostId:1][state:1]       (2 bytes)
///
/// state: 1 = entered a pausing-like UI state, 0 = exited. Sent on every
/// transition, not on a timer -- unlike Appearance there is no heartbeat,
/// because a late joiner who missed an "entered" they cannot still be
/// relevant to (the source's own tick has not stopped, so nothing about a
/// missed transition compounds the way a missed appearance change would).
///
/// Detected client-side by tailing kcd.log for engine-emitted markers that
/// bracket each state (docs/WO-11-findings.md addendum) -- no native hook,
/// since 0.2 showed none exists for these states. Only the log-tail
/// transport can see these lines; the HTTP transport never sends PauseUp.
///
/// **What a receiver does with it changed in WO-13.** WO-11 had every
/// receiver drop its own t_scale for as long as any peer reported paused.
/// That is retired and must not come back: it is correct for two players and
/// wrong at any real size, because in a 20-person session one player opening
/// their inventory would visibly slow the other nineteen. A player's own game
/// must never slow because someone else paused.
///
/// The packet survives as a pure presence signal: the receiver tags that
/// peer's ghost "[in menu]" so a motionless figure reads as "stepped away"
/// rather than broken. A manual `mp_slow_time` console command remains as an
/// independent, OR'd-in source of the same state, for states automatic
/// detection misses (tutorial popups and photo mode were never confirmed to
/// emit a log marker). Its name is now a misnomer -- it slows nothing; it
/// marks you as away.
///
/// Release version layer (WO-19). A friendly, non-fatal companion to the
/// Handshake version byte above -- that byte is wire *protocol*
/// compatibility and the relay hard-refuses a mismatch there, unconditionally,
/// unchanged by this. This layer is release *versioning* (VERSION,
/// docs/VERSIONING.md): two builds can speak identical protocol and still be
/// different releases, and a player on either side benefits from knowing that
/// even though the connection itself will work.
///
/// C→S  Handshake gains an optional trailing field, appended after
///      [name:UTF-8]: the sender's release version as UTF-8 text (e.g.
///      "0.9.5"). Optional and trailing, the same idiom as Invite's
///      [configLen][config] -- an old relay reads exactly
///      [version][nameLen][name] and never looks past it, so a new client's
///      extra bytes are silently ignored rather than breaking the parse.
///      A new relay talking to an old client simply finds nothing there.
/// S→C  0x1E  ReleaseVersion: [ghostId:1][releaseVersion:UTF-8]  -- no
///      explicit length field, exactly like Name (0x03): the outer
///      [type][payloadLen] framing already carries it. Broadcast to existing
///      peers when a client's Handshake carried one (mirrors BroadcastName),
///      and replayed to a new client for every existing peer that has one
///      (mirrors SendAllNamesTo). Never sent for a client whose Handshake
///      carried no release version, so an old agent build simply never
///      appears in a peer's map -- nothing to compare, nothing shown.
///
/// See <see cref="ReleaseVersionCompare"/> for how a receiver turns two of
/// these strings into "who's behind."
///
/// Shared player combat layer (WO-28). Replicates a *player's own* health,
/// hits taken from NPCs, and death -- the gap WO-26 Phase 3 measured: the
/// emit line carried position, rotation and two booleans, so when a test
/// ghost was killed the player it represented kept playing at full health.
///
/// The existing combat layer (0x12-0x15) cannot carry this and Protocol's own
/// comment above already says why: its targetGuid is only a valid cross-client
/// key because it names *authored* content, and every player's real Henry
/// carries the same SharedSoulGuid (4c2dcffb-... = player_henry, confirmed
/// live in WO-26 Phase 1) so it cannot distinguish one player from another
/// even in principle. Players are addressed by ghostId here instead.

///
/// Flow B, an NPC hurt a player. health/stamina are *loss amounts* (positive
/// magnitudes), matching CombatSoul::TakeDamage's own argument semantics, not
/// absolute values -- see the DLL's apply_damage. PlayerHitUp says "the ghost
/// representing player N lost this much in my world"; the relay routes it to
/// player N alone (it is NOT a broadcast) and drops the targetGhostId, since
/// the recipient does not need to be told it is about themselves.
///
/// Each peer runs an independent single-player simulation, so if every peer's
/// local NPCs generated hits against their local copy of every ghost, N peers
/// would produce N damage streams for one conceptual fight and multiply the
/// damage by N. NPC-versus-player combat is therefore authoritative on exactly
/// one client (Rule 2) -- see 0x25 below, which is how a client knows whether
/// it is that one.

/// 0x14 already gives: two clients computing "dead" from slightly divergent
/// health eventually disagree, and that disagreement does not self-correct.
/// Idempotent -- a repeat for an already-dead player is ignored.
///
/// What death *does* is settled outside this protocol: the player who died
/// reloads their own most recent save, ordinary single-player behaviour. Every
/// player has always run a fully separate save and there is no mechanism to
/// sync one player's save state to another's, so nobody else's world reverts.
/// Peers simply see that player's ghost reappear wherever their save point put
/// them once their game is back. See docs/WO-28-findings.md Phase 0 for what a
/// mid-session reload actually does to the connection and the mod's Lua state.
///
/// S→C  0x25  CombatRole: [isDamageAuthority:1]      (1)
///
/// Which client currently holds Rule 2's NPC→player damage authority. The
/// design this implements (docs/WO-26-shared-combat-design.md s3) names the
/// role but not how a client learns it holds it, and the agent has no notion
/// of "host" of its own -- ClientConfig only knows a relay address, and
/// inferring authority from that address being loopback would break silently
/// for anyone who starts the agent by hand. So the relay says so explicitly:
/// it designates the lowest-id ready client and sends this on assignment and
/// on every change (including when the holder leaves and it moves on).
///
/// This is the relay's only piece of derived per-session state, and it is not
/// world state -- it is a fact about the connection set the relay already
/// tracks. Both ends gate on it: a non-holder never sends PlayerHitUp, and the
/// relay drops a PlayerHitUp from a non-holder anyway.

///
/// One hand-placed NPC's position/state, streamed by the world authority so
/// every peer's local copy of that NPC mirrors the authority's copy instead of
/// running its own schedule. WO-32's live finding is what makes this a stream
/// and not a one-shot: a single external position write on a real NPC lands
/// and is then reverted by the engine to the NPC's schedule anchor within
/// ~1.5 s, while a continuous 50 ms write stream holds completely -- so the
/// receiver drives the NPC every interp tick for as long as packets keep
/// arriving, and simply stops when they stop, at which point the engine
/// restores the NPC to its own schedule on its own (observed: back on anchor
/// within 3 s, dialogue intact, no crime/faction side effects).
///
/// Addressed by entity NAME, not SharedSoulGuid: hand-placed NPCs' names are
/// authored level content, byte-identical on every install (same reason soul
/// GUIDs are a valid key for 0x12), and the receiving side is Lua, where
/// System.GetEntityByName is the only cheap lookup -- a GUID would have to be
/// resolved through the REST API on every apply. Runtime-spawned entities
/// (ghosts, kcd2mp_*) are excluded by the emitter; names are validated
/// [A-Za-z0-9_]+ before being interpolated into Lua.
///
/// Authority: reuses Rule 2's holder (0x25) as the DEFAULT stream -- one
/// world dictates NPC state, same single-authority shape and enforcement
/// point as PlayerHitUp. The emitting mod gates its ambient 30 m stream on
/// the same flag (KCD2MP.hitSensorOn), so a non-authority never ambiently
/// samples in the first place.
///
/// **Per-entity authority migration (WO-39 Phase 2):** a non-authority
/// client MAY send NpcStateUp for an entity its player is physically
/// manipulating (dragging/carrying a downed body -- the WO-38 report's
/// corpse-drag gap). Sending state for an entity IS the claim: there is no
/// claim packet. The relay's per-entity table (first claim wins, by relay
/// arrival order -- the TimeSkip arbitration shape) then routes that
/// entity's stream from the claimant and DROPS the global authority's
/// packets for it, which is also what closes the echo loop (the authority
/// re-sampling its own driven copy cannot re-broadcast it). The claim is
/// refreshed by every packet and expires after
/// <see cref="Protocol.NpcClaimTimeoutSeconds"/> of silence, or immediately
/// on the claimant's disconnect; the authority's stream then resumes.
/// Receivers need no notion of any of this -- they apply whatever
/// NpcStateDown arrives, whoever sent it.
///
/// **Proximity claims (WO-60):** a non-authority also runs the same 30 m
/// rescan/emit loop around its OWN player (mod toggle mp_npc_proximity, on
/// by default) and claims nearby NPCs through this exact mechanism -- a new
/// emitter, not a new rule. NPCs already streamed by someone else are
/// puppets on that machine and are excluded from its rescan, so a claim is
/// only ever attempted for an entity nobody is actively driving; the relay
/// stays the arbiter for races. Packets whose flags carry
/// <see cref="Protocol.NpcStateFlagEngaged"/> additionally arm a per-claim
/// engagement hold (<see cref="Protocol.NpcClaimEngagedHoldSeconds"/>) so a
/// claim on an actively-fought NPC cannot flap to another sender through a
/// brief packet gap. This is what closes WO-51 §1.4's "radius gap" and
/// "engagement asymmetry" rows: the machine actually near an NPC -- the one
/// simulating it at full fidelity -- becomes its stream.

///
/// Receivers apply with Calendar.SetWorldTime(target) **forward only** (the

/// keeps its own clock, so the residual divergence after any exchange is
/// bounded by overshoot, never by hours. A receiver whose own skip is still
/// resolving queues the target and applies it when its own skip ends.
///
/// Deliberately NOT gated on Rule 2's authority: any player's sleep counts
/// (the WO-38 spec: "when any player sleeps/waits/fast-travels"), so this
/// layer has its own first-come arbitration instead of the damage
/// authority's.
///
/// The relay's active-skip record expires after
/// <see cref="TimeSkipTimeoutSeconds"/> (a vanilla skip resolves in well
/// under a minute of real time) and is cleared into grace when its owner
/// disconnects, so a crashed sleeper cannot wedge the session.

/// ---- Horse identity layer (WO-38 Phase 5) ----
///
/// C→S  0x2A  HorseInfoUp:   [nameLen:1][name:UTF-8]                  (1 + nameLen)
/// S→C  0x2B  HorseInfoDown: [sourceGhostId:1][nameLen:1][name:UTF-8] (2 + nameLen)
///
/// Which world horse the sending player is currently riding, by entity name
/// -- the same cross-client key as the NPC sync layer, valid for the same
/// reason (authored entity names are byte-identical per install). nameLen 0
/// means dismounted, or mounted on a horse whose identity could not be read
/// (runtime-spawned horses have per-save generated names that do NOT travel).
///
/// The WO-38 report's Section D is the entire motivation: mounting used to
/// exist only as a boolean on the position stream, so the receiver spawned a
/// generic Horse-class proxy -- always the default (grey) look, phantom
/// (nothing but the mod knows it exists, so it cannot be mounted or hit),
/// and despawned on dismount. With the name on the wire, a receiver whose
/// world has the same-named horse adopts THAT entity as the ghost's mount:
/// right look, and a real, interactive horse that stays in the world after
/// the dismount. The proxy remains the fallback when the name is unknown or
/// not loaded here.
///
/// Sent on mount/dismount transitions plus a slow re-emit while mounted so a
/// late joiner converges -- the relay is stateless and replays nothing, the
/// same reasoning as Appearance. Broadcast to everyone; no authority gate
/// (like the pause layer, it is a fact about the sender, not about the
/// shared world).

/// ---- Combat visibility layer (WO-39 Phase 1) ----
///
/// C→S  0x2C  CombatEventUp:   [event:1]                    (1)   v2 (WO-99): [event:1][sid:2]                 (3)
/// S→C  0x2D  CombatEventDown: [sourceGhostId:1][event:1]   (2)   v2 (WO-99): [sourceGhostId:1][event:1][sid:2] (4)
///            sid = the sender's swing counter, the cross-machine correlation id for MP-SWING.
///            Relay accepts both lengths and forwards the body verbatim; a v1 receiver drops a v2 packet.
///
/// The WO-38 report's Phase 4 gap: the emit line carries position, rotation,
/// riding/sneaking flags, health, stamina, dead, unconscious -- and NOTHING
/// combat-shaped, so an observing player watched a friend stand motionless
/// with arms down through a whole real fight. This layer carries the visual
/// facts of the sender's combat state so their ghost can act them out.
///
/// event: 0 = weapon drawn, 1 = weapon sheathed, 2 = swing, 3 = block.
///
/// These are discrete transitions/events, not continuous state, which is why
/// this is its own low-rate packet pair (the PlayerHit shape) rather than a
/// widened Position/Ghost -- those are the hottest packets in the protocol
/// and a swing happens at most a couple of times per second. The mod
/// rate-limits swing/block emission and re-emits the drawn state on a slow
/// heartbeat while it holds (<see cref="CombatDrawnHeartbeatSeconds"/>), so a
/// late joiner converges -- the relay is stateless and replays nothing,
/// exactly as for Appearance and HorseInfo.
///
/// Everything here is COSMETIC on the receiving side: draw/sheathe call the
/// ghost's own Human scriptbinds (DrawWeapon/HolsterWeapon), swing/block play
/// one-shot animations. No damage flows through this layer -- real damage
/// keeps its existing authoritative paths (0x12 for NPCs, 0x21 for players),
/// so a spoofed or duplicated combat event can make a ghost wave a sword,
/// never hurt anyone. Broadcast to everyone; no authority gate (like the
/// pause and horse layers, it is a fact about the sender, not about the
/// shared world). Unknown event bytes are ignored by receivers, so this
/// enum can grow (stagger, hit-reaction) without a protocol bump.
///
/// ---- Weather sync layer (WO-40 Phase 3) ----
///
/// C→S  0x2E  WeatherUp:   [nameLen:1][profileName utf8][blendSec:2]                  (var)

///
/// The 2026-08-18 footage: "Weather is not synced at all... for PA it is
/// sunny, for PB it is foggy." The engine exposes a write
/// (EnvironmentModule.BlendTimeOfDay(profile, blend, force) -- officially
/// documented, used by Warhorse's own scripts) but NO current-profile read
/// (GetRainIntensity is the only readback), so the time-sync shape
/// "detect a local change, broadcast it" cannot work here: nobody can detect
/// vanilla weather changing. The session's weather is therefore
/// MOD-ARBITRATED: the damage-authority holder (an existing single-role
/// concept with relay-managed failover) picks a profile on a slow cadence,
/// applies it locally and broadcasts it; receivers apply the same profile.
/// Late joiners converge via the arbiter's heartbeat re-send (the relay is
/// stateless and replays nothing, exactly as for Appearance/HorseInfo).
///
/// Cosmetic by construction: weather affects mood and NPC flavor behavior,
/// no damage or authority flows through it. Broadcast, no relay gate -- only
/// the authority sends by convention, and a spoofed profile name can only
/// ever name a real table row (receivers validate charset; the engine
/// ignores unknown profiles).
///
/// ---- Name-addressed NPC damage layer (WO-40 Phase 5) ----
///

///
/// WO-39 Phase 3 proved the 0x12 wire guid is the per-save Soul Guid, not
/// SharedSoulGuid, and flagged cross-install stability as the open premise.
/// The 2026-08-18 bundles settled it: PA's guard-fight damage failed to
/// resolve on PB 571/571 times ("soul not loaded here") while the choke
/// victim applied 176/176 -- per-save Guids match for some NPCs and not
/// others, so guid-addressed damage is unreliable across installs. Entity
/// NAME is the proven stable cross-client key (NPC sync has used it since
/// WO-32). This layer sends damage by name: the sender translates its
/// per-save guid to the soul's name once (reflection REST, cached); the
/// receiver translates the name to ITS OWN per-save guid once (same REST,
/// cached) and applies through the existing DLL pipe. 0x12 remains the
/// fallback when the sender's name lookup fails, and still works whenever
/// the guids happen to match. A sender uses 0x30 OR 0x12 for one hit, never
/// both -- both resolving on the receiver would double-apply.
///
///                      flags bit 0: suppressHitReaction (as 0x12)
///                      flags bit 1: FATAL (WO-86) -- the sender's copy of this
///                                   NPC is dead. The receiver applies the
///                                   carried damage as usual and then kills
///                                   its own copy (the idempotent ApplyDeath
///                                   pipe command 0x14/0x15 were built for).
///
/// WO-86: death was never on the wire for NPCs. 0x14/0x15 (WO-4) exist with
/// a relay route and a receiver, but no client ever sent one -- the DLL's
/// LocalHit frame dropped its own `died` bit and SendLocalDeathAsync had no
/// caller -- so "is this NPC dead" was decided on every machine independently
/// from health deltas, which is exactly the divergence the 0x14 comment
/// predicted would never self-correct. A dead NPC is a name-addressed fact
/// like the damage that killed it, so it travels as a flag on 0x30 rather
/// than by re-wiring the guid-addressed 0x14 (per-save guids are unreliable
/// across installs, the premise WO-40 settled). health may be 0 on a FATAL
/// packet (the Lua observer saw the death, not the blow) or carry the killing
/// blow's delta (the DLL saw both). Protocol.Version is NOT bumped: additive
/// -- a pre-WO-86 receiver applies the damage and ignores the bit, a
/// pre-WO-86 sender never sets it -- the same reasoning as the WO-28 layer.

///
/// A player deliberately dropping an item for another player is direct
/// interaction, so it is shared; chests and NPC pockets stay per-player on
/// purpose (whoever loots first would empty them for everyone). This is a
/// TRANSACTIONAL layer, not a stream: a drop happens once, sits inert, and is
/// consumed exactly once — the time-skip arbitration shape, not the NPC
/// sync's continuous per-entity authority (whose flapping risk a static item
/// does not need to buy).
///
/// itemClass is the ItemClass GUID, the appearance layer's established
/// per-type key (byte-identical on every install). dropId is minted by the
/// dropping client's agent (random nonzero uint32) at broadcast time — a
/// player-dropped item has no authored identity, so one is created for it,
/// the same runtime-minting idiom as ghost ids. Every client keys its local
/// bookkeeping (dropId → its own world's entity/wuid) off it. health rides
/// along because two same-class items differ by condition, and the receiver's
/// CreateItem wants it; amount covers stackables (arrows, herbs).
///
/// Drop flow: the dropper's mod detects its player's own drop locally (new
/// PickableItem entity near the player + that class's inventory count
/// decreased — both halves required, which is what filters out world items
/// streaming in and NPCs dropping things nearby), the agent minted a dropId
/// and sends 0x32, the relay broadcasts 0x33 to the others. Receivers hold
/// the drop pending and only materialize the pickup entity once their local
/// player is within ~70 m — placing farther away was observed to drop the
/// entity through unstreamed ground (WO-48 findings). The dropper's agent
/// re-sends its still-unclaimed drops every
/// <see cref="ItemDropHeartbeatSeconds"/> so a late joiner converges;
/// receivers dedupe by dropId. The relay is stateless and replays nothing,
/// exactly as for Appearance.
///
/// Claim flow — the race case is the design case: both players can go for
/// the same item within one RTT. Each client's watcher notices its local
/// copy vanish (without the mod itself having removed it) and sends 0x34.
/// The relay echoes 0x35 to ALL clients INCLUDING the claimant, in arrival
/// order — its TCP serialization is the whole arbiter, no claim table. Every
/// client resolves a dropId on the FIRST 0x35 it sees and ignores repeats:
/// a copy still on the ground is removed (flagged first, so the watcher does
/// not read the removal as another claim — the 0x13 loop-prevention idiom);
/// the winning claimant keeps the item; a losing claimant deletes the gained
/// item from its inventory by the wuid it recorded at spawn time. The echo
/// must include the claimant: with others-only broadcast, two simultaneous
/// claimants would each see only the OTHER's claim and both roll back — the
/// item would evaporate. No client ever concludes "I won" from local state;
/// only the echo decides.

/// PR #1 merge message). Before this, a full relay just dropped the
/// connection with no packet, so a reconnecting client's generic "expected
/// Ack" error path could not tell "full" from any other refusal and kept
/// retrying every few seconds forever -- burning one byte-wide session id per
/// attempt on top of it. Fatal for the client like VersionMismatch: retrying
/// immediately cannot help, so the agent stops reconnecting on sight of this

/// whatsoever about where each player was in the story. Two players ran two
/// independent campaigns in one shared NPC name space, which is what the

///
/// **This layer is pure telemetry and deliberately changes no behaviour.** It
/// exists so each client can NAME the divergence it is already reacting to
/// locally (the receiver-side divergence release in kdcmp.lua, which needs no
/// agreement from anyone). A checkpoint save is a coarse clock -- six markers
/// in ninety minutes in the field logs -- which is precisely why it is not
/// used to gate anything: for most of the session in which one player dragged
/// the other's NPCs around, both clients' last-known objective was the SAME
/// string. Anything that gated NPC sync on this comparison would have been
/// silent through the actual damage. See docs/WO-90-findings.md.

/// estimate yet; it is logged (MP-CLOCK) and handed to the mod for display.
/// Ping (0x04/0x05) is left alone: its echo carries only the client's own

///
/// A pre-WO-98 relay skips an unknown 0x39 (payload read and discarded, the
