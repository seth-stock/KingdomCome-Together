	// Same first-claim shape as the time-skip arbitration above, applied per
	// entity name, and enforced HERE -- the relay is the single arbitration
	// point, so two clients acting on the same body resolve deterministically
	// by relay arrival order, never by comparing world states.
	//
	// There is deliberately NO claim packet. A non-authority client claims an
	// entity simply by sending NpcStateUp for it (the mod only does that while
	// its player is physically manipulating the body); the claim is refreshed
	// by every packet and expires after NpcClaimTimeoutSeconds of silence, at
	// which point the global authority's ordinary stream for that entity
	// resumes flowing. The global authority's own packets never create claims
	// -- its right to emit is the default, not a claim.
	//
	// This SUPERSEDES the WO-38 Phase 6 note that a non-authority's corpse
	// drag crosses no machine. The receive side needs no change at all: the
	// body-follow one-shot in KCD2MP_NpcPuppetTick applies whoever the sender
	// is, and the echo loop is closed by this same gate (the authority's
	// re-sample of a body someone else is driving is dropped here).

	// WO-60 adds EngagedUtc: the last time the OWNER's packet carried the
	// ENGAGED flag (its player actively fighting this NPC). While that is
	// recent (NpcClaimEngagedHoldSeconds), the claim is HELD -- it cannot
	// expire on silence and cannot be taken by anyone, so a menu pause or
	// packet gap mid-fight cannot snap the entity to another sender's
	// diverged stream and back (the flap this hold exists to prevent). A
	// claim never engaged (a corpse drag) keeps the plain 5 s expiry
	// unchanged. Disconnect still releases immediately either way.
	//
	// WO-66 adds X/Y/Z: the position of the last ACCEPTED update, the speed
	// gate's baseline. It lives inside the claim entry ON PURPOSE: claim
	// expiry, disconnect clear, and reclaim all destroy it with the entry, so
	// a new claimant's first packet is never speed-checked against a previous
	// owner's data -- it seeds a fresh baseline instead.
	// WO-81 adds GrantedUtc: when this claim entry was first created, kept
	// alongside LastUtc (last accepted refresh) so a release can log
	// heldForSec -- how long the claim actually lasted, not just how stale it
	// was when it finally lapsed.
