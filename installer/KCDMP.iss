;   * deploys the game mod into <ModdingTools>\Mods\kdcmp,
;   * pre-seeds the launcher's settings.json with the game path it found, so
;     first launch needs zero configuration,
;   * installs the WebView2 runtime when missing, which the Photino-based
;     launcher cannot render without.

; The whole Publish-Release.ps1 output: launcher, agent, relay, native DLL,
; injector, and the self-contained .NET runtime beside them. The launcher
; resolves relative DllPath/AgentPath/RelayPath against its own directory,
; so this flat layout is the one AppSettings' defaults already expect.
;
; overwritereadonly (WO-74) is not decoration. Without it, ONE read-only file
; anywhere in the install directory stops the entire install dead: Inno raises
; "The existing file could not be replaced because it is marked read-only" as
; an Abort/Retry/Ignore box, /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES answers Abort, and Setup exits
; 5 -- the same code as a user pressing Cancel. Reproduced on 2026-08-28
; against Setup 0.18.8: the abort landed on appsettings.json, the third file
; alphabetically, so every file after it kept its old build, and the mod
; folder had already been emptied by PrepareToInstall. A read-only attribute
; is not exotic: restores from backup, copies off read-only media, and some
; antivirus quarantine-restores all set it.

; The game mod, and ONLY these two files. Do not turn this back into a
; wildcard over kdcmp\.
;
; kdcmp\Data\ also holds the pak's *sources* -- Libs\Tables\...,
; Scripts\Startup\kdcmp.lua -- which tools\Build-And-Install-
; Mod.ps1 packs into kdcmp.pak and deliberately does not copy. Deploying them
; loose as well breaks the game outright: a loose Data\Libs\Tables directory
; inside a mod takes over the engine's table root, and every base table then
; fails to resolve. The game dies at startup with "114 tables are not loaded",
; and nothing in that message points at this. Observed for real on 2026-07-30.
;
; uninsneveruninstall is deliberate and load-bearing too: without it the
; uninstaller silently deletes these files out of the player's game folder,
; which is not ours to do unasked. Removal is handled by the explicit
; question in CurUninstallStepChanged instead.

{ WO-74. What RemoveModFolder used to be called for on every upgrade, and why
  it is not any more.

  PrepareToInstall deleted the whole mod folder before the file copy ran.
  When that copy then aborted -- one read-only file in the install dir was enough, see
  the Files-section comment -- the player was left with NO mod in their game
  at all, from an installer that reported nothing but a cancel. Observed on
  2026-08-28 against Setup 0.18.8. (A line here may not start with a square
  bracket, even inside a comment: ISCC reads it as a section tag.)

  So for our own upgrades: prune instead of delete. Everything that is not
  one of the two files we own goes (that is what the delete was really for --
  clearing loose pak *sources*, a stray Data\Libs\Tables being the failure
  that started it), and the two we own are left in place for [Files] to
  overwrite. An install that dies half way now leaves the previous version's
  mod working rather than no mod at all.

  A foreign kdcmp still gets the full RemoveModFolder after the explicit ask:
  keeping half of somebody else's mod would be worse than replacing it. }

{ ================================================ verify, sweep and repair }

{ WO-32 follow-up, rebuilt in WO-74 -- the install proves itself before
  declaring success, and repairs what it can before judging.

  Build-Installer.ps1 writes install-manifest.txt into the payload after
  publish (APP|<rel>|<size>|<sha256> for the install dir, MOD|... for the two files in
  the game folder), so it ships inside the install directory and describes
  exactly what this Setup carried.

  Three things changed in WO-74, each closing a way the old check could
  report PASS over a broken install:

    * sha256, not just size. A stale file that happened to match on length
      passed. "Every stale-vs-built pair observed differed in size" was luck.
    * the mod half is verified too. It lands outside the install dir and was checked by
      nothing at all -- a run that left the game with an EMPTY mod folder
      still wrote PASS (observed 2026-08-28, Setup 0.18.8).
    * the install dir is a CLOSED set. The manifest used to be a whitelist, so any file
      that no release ships -- a hand `dotnet publish` into the install
      directory, an assembly from an older layout -- sat there forever,
      invisible to the check and perfectly able to break assembly loading.
      That is the shape of the relay that could not cold-start in WO-69.
      Managed extensions (.dll .exe .pdb .deps.json .runtimeconfig.json) that
      are not in the manifest are now deleted and named in the report.

  Deliberately NOT swept: everything else. settings.json, favorites.json,
  custom_servers.json, the logs, and anything a user dropped in there are
  none of Setup's business, and an installer that eats user files to tidy up
  is a worse bug than the one being fixed. }
