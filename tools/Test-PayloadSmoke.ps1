.SYNOPSIS
    WO-110 R10: prove the published release payload is coherent and runs --
    relay up, agent connects, one round trip, both exit -- and fail otherwise.

.DESCRIPTION
    tools\Publish-Release.ps1 flat-merges four self-contained publishes into
    release\KCDMP; later projects overwrite shared DLLs (Microsoft.Extensions.*,
    Serilog.*, System.Text.Json, KcdMp.Protocol.dll). Before WO-110 nothing
    ever STARTED that folder before Setup embedded it: unit tests ran against
    bin\, the relay round-trip gate hosted the relay in-process from the test
    project, and the merged payload shipped unexecuted (docs/WO-109-audit.md
    R10). The 0.11.8 and WO-69/74 incidents were both "a DLL in the install
    directory was the wrong build" and neither would have been caught.

    The first run of this gate (2026-09-22, against the 0.26.4-era tree)
    found exactly that class of defect: the relay's publish overwrote the
    agent's System.Text.Json 8.0 with 10.0, which needs System.IO.Pipelines
    10.0 -- present in the folder but absent from KcdMpClient.deps.json, so
    the agent's loader could not see it and every JSON write in the shipped
    agent failed ("Could not load file or assembly 'System.IO.Pipelines,
    Version=10.0.0.0'"). Hence part A below.

    A. Static coherence report: for every *.deps.json in the payload, every
       runtime assembly it lists is compared against the merged folder's
       copy and each version difference is printed (higher / LOWER). This
       is a WARN, not a gate: the .NET host accepts a higher copy, and the
       launcher has always shipped a few lower type-forwarding facades.
       The failure that actually bit (an unlisted transitive dependency)
       is not visible statically; part B is the gate for it.
    B. Runtime smoke:
       1. copy the payload to a temp folder (byte-identical; a copy so the
          run's own kcdmp-client.json, agent.log and relay.log never land in
          the folder the installer embeds -- New-InstallManifest.ps1 would
          otherwise ship them);
       2. start KcdMpServer.exe from that copy on a free TCP port with its
          HTTP listener on a random loopback port (no clash with a live relay
          on 7778/5273, no master-server announce);
       3. run KcdMpClient.exe --relay-smoke against it: real Handshake with
          this build's protocol byte and release version, Ack, one Ping/Pong
          (RelaySmoke.cs); exit 0 with a RELAY-SMOKE ok line, else 1;
       4. the agent's stdout must carry no "Could not load file or assembly"
          / "Unhandled exception" line -- a caught-and-logged load failure
          is still a broken payload;
       5. stop the relay, delete the copy, exit non-zero on any failure.

    Same-build only by construction: both exes come from the same payload,
    so a release-version refusal (WO-110 R9) cannot fire here -- that path
    has its own relay gate test.
