.SYNOPSIS
    One command, one Setup.exe.

.DESCRIPTION
    Runs tools\Publish-Release.ps1 to assemble release\KCDMP, then compiles
    installer\KCDMP.iss with Inno Setup's command-line compiler into
    release\KingdomComeTogether-Setup-<version>.exe (WO-134: the new name; KCDMP-Setup-<version>.exe before).

    The version comes from the VERSION file at the repo root and from nowhere
    else: it is stamped into the Setup filename, the installer's Add/Remove
    Programs entry, and the exe's own version resource.

.PARAMETER SkipPublish
    Compile the installer against whatever release\KCDMP already contains.
    Only useful when iterating on the .iss -- a full publish is minutes.

.EXAMPLE
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\Build-Installer.ps1

    [switch]$SkipPublish,

# WO-32 follow-up, rewritten in WO-74: write a manifest of everything this
# Setup carries so the installer can prove, after installing, that every file
# actually landed -- and that nothing ELSE is sitting in the install directory
# pretending to belong there.
#
# Motivated by two real incidents:
#   * Setup 0.11.8 ran while agent/relay processes were alive, silently left
#     KcdMpClient.dll and KcdMpServer.dll on an old build, and the
#     newly-shipped NPC sync was inert with no error anywhere (WO-32).
#   * A relay that could not cold-start because the install directory held a
#     Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.* assembly from a foreign publish
#     -- a file no release ever shipped, so no overwrite could ever fix it
#     and the size-only whitelist could not see it (WO-69, WO-74).
#
# Format (v2, WO-74) -- <kind>|<relative path>|<size>|<sha256>:
#   APP  a file in the install directory, relative to it
#   MOD  a file in <ModdingTools>\Mods\kdcmp, relative to that folder
#
# APP is a CLOSED set: the installer deletes any .dll/.exe/.pdb/.deps.json/
# .runtimeconfig.json in the install directory that is not listed here. MOD
# entries exist because the mod half lands in the game folder, outside the
# install directory, and was previously verified by nothing at all -- an
# install that deployed no pak still reported PASS.
#
# tools\New-InstallManifest.ps1 owns the format; both delivery routes call it.
# It runs AFTER the pak rebuild and AFTER publish, and BEFORE ISCC, so it
# describes exactly the bytes this Setup is about to embed. That order is
# load-bearing: kdcmp.pak is NOT byte-deterministic (same size, different
# sha256 on a rebuild from identical sources -- observed 2026-08-28), so a
# manifest written before a later rebuild describes a pak that no longer
# exists and fails verification on a perfectly good artifact.
