.SYNOPSIS
    Tests the installer's Steam/Modding-Tools detection against synthetic
    fixtures and against this machine's real Steam library.

.DESCRIPTION
    Builds a fixture tree of fake Steam libraries (multi-library, missing app,
    malformed vdf, retail-instead-of-modding-tools, ...), compiles
    installer\tests\SteamDetectProbe.iss -- which #includes the installer's
    own installer\SteamDetect.iss, so this exercises the shipping code rather
    than a copy of it -- runs it against each fixture, and asserts the result.

    No game and no Steam interaction required. Safe to run any time: nothing
    outside the temp fixture tree is written.

.EXAMPLE
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\Test-InstallerDetect.ps1
